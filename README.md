Smart Shopper (An eBay hackathon product)
==================


- What is Smart Shopper? 
Are you bored of running the same errands around town? Make your shopping experience exciting by using the Smart Shopper app! Smart Shopper shows you the eBay sellers around your town and lets you choose which seller to purchase from. You get reward points for every purchase you make from a seller. The points you get would depend on 3 factors- Distance between you and the seller, your mode of transportation and whether the item is charitable. You will be competing with your friends and thus you must do your best to stay on top of the leaderboard for extra goodies!

- What's under the hood?
Smart Shopper leverages the Milo APIs provided by eBay to get information on local sellers and the Google Map and Transit APIs to plot those sellers on a map view. The back-end processing is handled by server-side PHP scripts and the front-end UI is implemented using jQuery, HTML5 and CSS.

- This app is a product of 18 hours of hacking at eBay's Hackathon event conducted in the campus of Georgia Tech.
